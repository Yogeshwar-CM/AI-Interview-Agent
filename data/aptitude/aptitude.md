## Logical Reasoning

### Pattern Recognition

- **Example 1**: The candidate is presented with a sequence of shapes and is asked to identify the next shape in the sequence.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is given a series of numbers and is asked to determine the pattern and predict the next number.

### Deductive Reasoning

- **Example 1**: The candidate is given a set of statements and is asked to draw logical conclusions based on the information provided.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is presented with a scenario and is asked to identify the logical outcome based on the given conditions.

### Problem-Solving

- **Example 1**: The candidate is given a complex problem and is asked to break it down into smaller, manageable parts, explaining their thought process and approach.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is asked to solve a puzzle or brainteaser, demonstrating their problem-solving skills and logical reasoning.

## Numerical Ability

### Arithmetic Calculations

- **Example 1**: The candidate is asked to perform basic arithmetic calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is given a series of mathematical problems and is asked to solve them accurately and efficiently.

### Data Interpretation

- **Example 1**: The candidate is presented with a set of data in the form of charts, graphs, or tables and is asked to interpret the information and draw conclusions.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is given a dataset and is asked to perform calculations to determine key metrics, such as averages, percentages, and ratios.

### Numerical Reasoning

- **Example 1**: The candidate is given a word problem that involves numerical reasoning and is asked to solve it, explaining their thought process and approach.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is asked to identify patterns and relationships between numbers in a given set of data.

## Verbal Ability

### Reading Comprehension

- **Example 1**: The candidate is given a passage of text and is asked to answer questions based on the information provided.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is asked to summarize a given text, highlighting the main points and key details.

### Vocabulary and Grammar

- **Example 1**: The candidate is asked to identify and correct grammatical errors in a given sentence or passage.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is given a list of words and is asked to provide definitions or use them in sentences to demonstrate their understanding.

### Verbal Reasoning

- **Example 1**: The candidate is presented with a series of statements and is asked to determine whether they are true, false, or cannot be determined based on the information provided.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is given a set of analogies and is asked to identify the relationship between the words and complete the analogy.

## Spatial Reasoning

### Visualizing Shapes and Patterns

- **Example 1**: The candidate is given a set of shapes and is asked to identify the odd one out based on their characteristics.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is presented with a 3D object and is asked to visualize and draw its 2D representation from different angles.

### Mental Rotation

- **Example 1**: The candidate is given a shape and is asked to identify its rotated version from a set of options.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is asked to mentally rotate a 3D object and determine its orientation after a series of rotations.

### Spatial Visualization

- **Example 1**: The candidate is given a complex figure and is asked to identify how it would look if folded or unfolded.
- **Example 2**: The candidate is presented with a series of connected shapes and is asked to determine how they fit together to form a complete figure.

## Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive set of examples and scenarios to train the AI agent on various aptitude skills. By leveraging these examples, the agent can effectively assess candidates' logical reasoning, numerical ability, verbal ability, and spatial reasoning skills during the interview process.
